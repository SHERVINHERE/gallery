<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><em>What if a wall had legs and could walk? What if it had a brain of its own and could decide where to go? Where would it go? What would it like to do?</em></p>
<p>We say the lonely wall would love to join crowds — see what they are doing, and help them in any way it can. The friendly wall down the neighborhood finds crowds and provides them with privacy, a whiteboard, a presentation board, and more.</p>
