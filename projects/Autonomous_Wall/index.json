What would it like to do?</em></p>\n<p>We say the lonely wall would love to join crowds — see what they are doing, and help them in any way it can. The friendly wall down the neighborhood finds crowds and provides them with privacy, a whiteboard, a presentation board, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>Made at:</strong> UCLA AUD, IDEAS — Greg Lynn, Martha Nowak studio</p>\n",
