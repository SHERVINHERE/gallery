<p>They have employed lanes to separate different modes of mobility, yet separation itself is not the true objective. Rather, it is a strategy to make movement more predictable in terms of direction and speed. However, this approach inevitably sacrifices the beauty of coexistence, the richness of multiple modes sharing a single surface, in favor of safety.</p>
<p>If we cannot scale the environment down to a human dimension, then the essential principle must be to slow all movement to the pace of the pedestrian. To achieve this, we can introduce subtle obstacles along the way, ensuring that nothing moves faster than the human body in motion. At the same time, these obstacles can serve as filters, allowing certain modes of transportation to pass based on their sizeâ€”what fits continues, and what does not is gently excluded.</p>
