<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Architecture without people.</strong></p>
<p><em>Artificial Nature</em> is a Data Center that collaborates with the city both physically and conceptually.</p>
<p>It’s a scene of future technology. A monument one can touch, climb, populate and inhabit. A park where one can walk, run, relax, play, hold parties and events. A living mechanism that grows as the need grows.</p>
<p>It’s a battlefield between the need for nature and technology, an open poll where people can decide how they want their future to be like.<br>
“The more outdoor activities you have, The fewer data storage you’ll need.”</p>
